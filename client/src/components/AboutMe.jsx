                <p className="subtitle is-4">
                    Hi, I'm Isayah, an aspiring software engineer based in
                    Orange County, California. What inspired me to pursue
                    software engineering was my experience running a
                    tech-startup for NFTs, where I had to collaborate with
                    developers to create a mobile app and website. As the CEO, I
                    wanted to gain a better understanding of the technical
                    aspects of our product, and learned a lot in the process.
                </p>

                <p className="subtitle is-4">
                    I am proficient in HTML, CSS, JavaScript, and have some
                    experience with Python. My web development skills were honed
                    during my Bootcamp course with UC Berkeley, where I learned
                    to be a full-stack developer. Additionally, I have worked on
                    several projects, both solo and with a team, including a
                    recipe generator and a social-media/trading platform hybrid
                    app.
                </p>

                <p className="subtitle is-4">
                    What makes me a strong candidate for a software engineering
                    role are my technical and soft skills. I am a curious
                    person, always striving to learn something new, and very
                    ambitious, always pushing myself and my team to do our best
                    work. I have experience as a leader and am able to inspire
                    and earn the respect of others. In approaching
                    problem-solving, I make an effort to understand the issue at
                    hand and research potential solutions, but also plan my work
                    ahead of time to prevent issues from arising.
                </p>

                <p className="subtitle is-4">
                    Looking to the future, I aspire to work on projects that I
                    find compelling and meaningful, and to make a positive
                    impact through my work. Outside of software engineering, I
                    have 5 years of experience in the mortgage industry as a
                    loan officer, which has given me valuable skills in
                    communication and customer service.
                </p>

                <p className="subtitle is-4">
                    Thank you for taking the time to learn more about me. I look
                    forward to the opportunity to work with you and create
                    something great together.
                </p>
